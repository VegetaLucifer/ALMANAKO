        <h2>Michael Jackson</h2>
        <p>
          Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an
          American singer, songwriter, dancer, and philanthropist. Known as the
          "King of Pop", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural
          figures of the 20th century. During his four-decade career, his
          contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized
          personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture. Jackson
          influenced artists a cross many music genres. Through stage and video
          performances, he popularized complicated street dance moves such as
          the moonwalk, which he named, as well as the robot. The eighth child
          of the Jackson family, Jackson made his public debut in 1964 with his
          older brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the
          Jackson 5 (later known as the Jacksons). Jackson began his solo career
          in 1971 while at Motown Records. He became a solo star with his 1979
          album Off the Wall. His music videos, including those for "Beat It",
          "Billie Jean", and "Thriller" from his 1982 album Thriller, are
          credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming the medium
          into an art form and promotional tool. He helped propel the success of
          MTV and continued to innovate with videos for the albums Bad (1987),
          Dangerous (1991), HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I (1995),
          and Invincible (2001). Thriller became the best-selling album of all
          time, while Bad was the first album to produce five US Billboard Hot
          100 number-one singles.[nb 1]

        <h2>Madonna</h2>
        <p>
          Madonna Louise Ciccone[a] (/tʃɪˈkoʊni/; Italian: [tʃikˈkoːne]; born
          August 16, 1958) is an American singer, songwriter, and actress. Known
          as the "Queen of Pop", Madonna has been widely recognized for her
          continual reinvention and versatility in music production,
          songwriting, and visual presentation. She has pushed the boundaries of
          artistic expression in mainstream music while maintaining control over
          every aspect of her career.[2] Her works, which incorporate social,
          political, sexual, and religious themes, have generated both
          controversy and critical acclaim. A prominent cultural figure spanning
          both the 20th and 21st centuries, Madonna remains one of the most
          "well-documented figures of the modern age",[3] with a broad array of
          scholarly reviews, literature, and art works about her, as well as an
          academic mini subdiscipline devoted to her called Madonna studies.
          Madonna moved to New York City in 1978 to pursue a career in modern
          dance. After performing as a drummer, guitarist, and vocalist in the
          rock bands Breakfast Club and Emmy, she rose to solo stardom with her
          debut studio album, Madonna (1983). She followed it with a series of
          successful albums, including all-time bestsellers Like a Virgin
          (1984), True Blue (1986), and The Immaculate Collection (1990), as
          well as Grammy Award winners Ray of Light (1998) and Confessions on a
          Dance Floor (2005). Madonna has amassed many chart-topping singles
          throughout her career, including hits such as "Like a Virgin", "La
          Isla Bonita", "Like a Prayer", "Vogue", "Take a Bow", "Frozen",
          "Music", "Hung Up", and "4 Minutes". Madonna's popularity was enhanced
          by roles in films such as Desperately Seeking Susan (1985), Dick Tracy
          (1990), A League of Their Own (1992), and Evita (1996). While the
          lattermost won her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress, many of her
          other films were not as well received. As a businesswoman, Madonna
          founded the company Maverick in 1992, which included Maverick Records,
          one of the most successful artist-run labels in history.

        <h2>Prince</h2>
        <p>
          Prince Rogers Nelson (June 7, 1958 – April 21, 2016) was an American
          singer, songwriter, musician, record producer, and actor. The
          recipient of numerous awards and nominations, he is widely regarded as
          one of the greatest musicians of his generation.[6] He was known for
          his flamboyant, androgynous persona;[7][8] his wide vocal range, which
          included a far-reaching falsetto and high-pitched screams; and his
          skill as a multi-instrumentalist, often preferring to play all or most
          of the instruments on his recordings.[9] His music incorporated a wide
          variety of styles, including funk, R&B, rock, new wave, soul,
          synth-pop, pop, jazz, blues and hip hop. Prince produced his albums
          himself, pioneering the Minneapolis sound. Born and raised in
          Minneapolis, Prince signed a record deal with Warner Bros. Records at
          the age of 19, soon releasing the albums For You (1978) and Prince
          (1979). He went on to achieve critical success with the influential
          albums Dirty Mind (1980), Controversy (1981), and 1999 (1982). His
          sixth album, Purple Rain (1984), was recorded with his new backing
          band the Revolution, and was also the soundtrack to the film of the
          same name in which he starred. Purple Rain garnered continued success
          for Prince and was a major commercial achievement, spending six
          consecutive months atop the Billboard 200 chart.[10] The soundtrack
          also won Prince the Academy Award for Best Original Song Score. After
          disbanding the Revolution, Prince released the album Sign o' the Times
          (1987), widely hailed by critics as the greatest work of his career.
          In the midst of a contractual dispute with Warner Bros. in 1993, he
          changed his stage name to the unpronounceable symbol Logo. Hollow
          circle above downward arrow crossed with a curlicued horn-shaped
          symbol and then a short bar (known to fans as the "Love Symbol") and
          was often referred to as The Artist Formerly Known as Prince (or
          TAFKAP) or simply The Artist.[11][12] After moving to Arista Records
          in 1998, Prince reverted to his original name in 2000. Over the next
          decade, six of his albums entered the U.S. top 10 charts.
